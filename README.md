# Raissa
A chat application in React, Nodejs and Django.

**Description**

It's an application where you can authenticate and log into a public chat.

The name of the application is Raissa because I think that name is beautiful. Something similar to what happened in the Julia language, which was not chosen in reference to any developer, they thought this was a good name to use.
